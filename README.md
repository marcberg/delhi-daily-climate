# delhi-daily-climate

This project was just for fun because I wanted to try out my code I wrote for my master thesis on a completly new data. So I downloaded "delhi-daily-climate" from Kaggle. 
The data is perhaps to easy to do predicitons on but I made it just for fun.

Predicting the 4 parameters "meantemp", "humidity", "wind_speed", "meanpressure" in the city of Delhi, India.
